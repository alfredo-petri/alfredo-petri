# 👋 Hello, I’m Alfredo A. Petri

</div>

Frontend Software Engineer with +15 years in technology and +4 years of professional experience designing and delivering scalable Web and Mobile applications. My background combines hands-on technical execution with architectural decision-making in real production environments.

I specialize in **React and React Native**, building **TypeScript-driven architectures** focused on performance, scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. My work emphasizes rendering optimization, scalable state management strategies, reusable component systems, and frontend architectures aligned with Clean Architecture and SOLID principles.

Currently, I lead frontend architecture at **Bike Fácil**, developing real-time **urban mobility (MAAS)** solutions that integrate REST APIs and IoT devices such as smart bike stations, access control systems, and biometric readers. I was also responsible for the original Proof of Concept that enabled the company’s public-sector partnership initiative.

Previously, I contributed to the development of **StartJa**, a transactional and fiscal management system (invoicing, inventory, customer and supplier management), as well as e-commerce and EdTech platforms. Across projects, I have migrated legacy systems (CRA to Vite), modernized frontend architectures, and contributed to Docker-based environments and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🏗 Engineering Approach

I believe frameworks are tools — architecture is the foundation.

I design systems using:

- Clean Architecture  
- SOLID principles  
- Feature-based and layered structures  
- Strong typing with TypeScript  
- Automated testing (Jest, Vitest, Testing Library)  
- Performance-first and accessibility-oriented mindset  

My focus is long-term maintainability, scalability, and building frontend systems that evolve safely over time.
